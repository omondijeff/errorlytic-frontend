Errorlytic Pricing Strategy Guide

1. Pricing Philosophy

Errorlytic pricing is designed to be flexible, scalable, and accessible to
different types of users in East Africa and beyond. The model balances
pay-per-use micropayments for casual/low-volume users with subscription
tiers for garages and insurers who need consistent access. The goal is
to:

- Lower barriers to entry for small garages and individuals.

- Provide predictable costs for businesses.

- Ensure high-value enterprise offerings for insurers and large repair
  networks.

2. Pricing Models

A. Pay-Per-API Call (Micropayments)

- Target Users: Small garages, car communities, individual car owners.

- How It Works: Users pay for each API request (analysis, quotation, or
  repair walkthrough).

- Proposed Rate:

  - $0.30 – $0.50 per call (KES 40–70).

  - Bundles: e.g., 50 calls/month for a reduced price.
